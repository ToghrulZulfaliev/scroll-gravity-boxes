# Scroll Gravity Boxes (Framer Motion)

A scroll-responsive UI animation built with React and Framer Motion.

Description
This project demonstrates how UI elements can dynamically respond to scroll speed and direction.
As the user scrolls faster, the boxes react with stronger motion, creating a gravity-like,
physics-inspired interaction commonly used in modern landing pages and portfolios.

 Key Concepts
- Scroll velocity calculation using delta values (dy / dt)
- Direction-based animation logic
- Spring-based animations with Framer Motion
- requestAnimationFrame for performance optimization
- GPU-accelerated transforms (translate & rotate)

 Tech Stack
- React (Functional Components)
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind CSS

 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand how to convert user scroll input into smooth,
interactive UI animations while keeping performance stable.
